                <strong>Rules &amp; Regulations</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You can make 3 selections daily, your NAP, NB &amp; Res:</p>
              <p>You NAP (Napoleon) should be your best selection of the day</p>
              <p>
                Your NB (Next Best thing) is your next best selection for the
                day
              </p>
              <p>
                Your Res (Reserve) is your reserve selection in case one of your
                NAP or NB becomes a non-runner
              </p>
              <p>
                The results of the competition will be worked out based on
                either the XSP or the odds at the time of selection based on
                whether you have ticked "Take XSP" in the NAP entry dialogue
              </p>
              <p>
                The NAP comp is win only, let's be fair if it's a NAP you
                shouldn't be picking each way ;)
                <br />
                In the case of multiple non-runners from your daily NAP
                selections you will not be able to submit replacement NAP
                selections, but will only be scored on the selections that do
                run.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need to be sharing your NAPs in a public environment,
                having&nbsp;your social media account in private or
                protected&nbsp;mode will result in your disqualification from
                that competition.&nbsp;

              <p>
                You will only qualify for the Monthly competition prizes if you

                  <strong>Special Event specific rules</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                  You will only qualify for Special Event competition if you
                  have entered&nbsp;at least one&nbsp;qualifying Nap
                  selection*&nbsp;on at least 50% of the days that a Special
                  event is being run for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  i.e. For a 4 day event like Cheltenham Festival you must have
                  at least one&nbsp;qualifying Nap selection* on 2 of the 4 days
                  of the festival.
                </p>
                <p>
                  *one&nbsp;qualifying Nap selection (a bet than contributes a
                  positive or negative amount to your daiy total)

                  <strong>Handling Dead heats</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the event of a Dead heat we have to decide upon some rules
                  to decide who takes the prize. There can only be one
                  winner!&nbsp;
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  1. First up, we count the Reserve(s). Most profitable wins!
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Second up, we look to see who has the highest strike rate.
                  Highest strike rate wins!
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Third up, we look to see who played the most in that given
                  competition. Most times played wins!
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
